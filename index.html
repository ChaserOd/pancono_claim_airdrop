  <br />

 
<h2>Download Wallet for Mining</h2>
<p>Click above<strong> 'Download Core Wallet'( Available only for Window),</strong> at Github page find the <strong>'Pancono.Core.Wallet & Core.wallet'zip files</strong> at the bottom. Download both the files, extract it and start mining by double clicking the <strong>application</strong> file. User can choose whether to mine points or coins accordingly. Read instruction on how to mine at the application.</p>
<br />
<p><strong> Mine per block in every 1 to 2 min.</strong> Mine on Laptop/Desktop (CPU/GPU) with low mining dificulty. For each successful block mined on the blockchain, users will earn <strong>30 PANNO</strong></p>
<p>Keep both the downloaded folder secure. At a later stage, we may request you to submit the folders for verification. The verification process will take place during mainnet launch.</p>


<br />
  
<h2>Peer to Peer Connection </h2>
<p>
You may notice no peers connected at core wallet. Peers connections in the wallet are currently disabled, so sending or receiving coins is not yet available. To enable peers connections, full blockchain connectivity & wallet functionality so you can send receive coins, you must invite 10 friends at above Pancono's Telegram bot. 
Once you complete the invitations, both of your downloaded core wallet will become eligible for automatic peer connections and will get connected to Mainnet blockchain during the Mainnet launch.
     </p>
<p>
Note that you must invite friends before Mainnet launch period or you may lose all your mined points and coins. 
    </p>
  <p>
 So get your invite friends link from above 'Pancono Telegram Bot' button. At bot find your 'invite friend link', share it at social media to start inviting friends. Users can also check their total invited friends count at bot.

  <h1> What is different between Pancono coins and Points? </h1> 

<p> At Pancono.Core.Wallet.zip folder users will be able to mine Pancono Coins. Whereas at Core.wallet.zip file users will be able to mine Points of other projects of out partners who have launched their own coin at Pancono ecosystem. When you mine <strong>Pancono coins</strong>, you are directly participating in the <strong>Pancono airdrop</strong>, and all rewards will be credited in <strong>Pancono coins (PANNO)</strong>. When you mine <strong>Points</strong>, it means you are mining <strong>other newly launched coins of partner's projects</strong> that will be added to the Pancono ecosystem during the Mainnet launch. </p> 
  <p> The conversion of points into coins those projects— and receiving those coins in your wallet — will depend on multiple factors, such as: <br>• The block height at which the points were mined <br>• Total number of blocks mined <br>• Which partner projects the users joined during the mining phase </p> <p> In simple terms: <strong>every user will earn both Pancono coins and additional partner coins</strong>, all of which will be distributed during the **Pancono Mainnet launch** as part of the blockchain ecosystem rewards. </p>

   <h1> Total Supply of Pancono Coin </h1> 
<p> Pancono’s max supply is capped at 30 million, making it a low-supply coin. Scarcity creates higher long-term value potential, giving early miners and active community members the biggest advantage.  </p>
